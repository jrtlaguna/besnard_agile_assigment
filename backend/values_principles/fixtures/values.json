The Waterfall approach or Traditional methodologies only allow customers to negotiate before and after the project. This used to result in wastage of both time and resources.

Circumstances change and sometimes customers demand extra features in the final product that may change the project scope. In these cases, project managers and their teams must adapt quickly in order to deliver a quality product and ensure 100% customer satisfaction."
